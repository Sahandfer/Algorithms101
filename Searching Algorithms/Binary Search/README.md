# Binary Search

## Introduction

## Demonstration
There are two examples provided for the binary search algorithm:
1) guess_random_num.dart: This program finds a random number within a given range.
2) search_array_item.dart: This program searches for an item in the array.

You can try these programs by running the following command:

```shell
cd Binary\ Search
dart [filename].dart
```

## Runtime
The runtime for this algorithm is O(log n).
