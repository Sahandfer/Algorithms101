There is one example provided for the selection sort algorithm; this example sorts a given array in the ascending order. 
You can try these programs by running the following command:

```shell
cd Selection\ Sort
dart sort_array_asc.dart
```

## Runtime
The runtime for this algorithm is O(n^2).
