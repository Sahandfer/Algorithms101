# Sorting Algorithms
> The world would be such a mess if there was no way to sort things out.

## Instructions
You can make changes to the arr variable in Main.dart to sort different values. Then, you can test the provided algorithms with:

```shell
    dart Main.dart [Algorithm name]
```

Algorithm name can be:
- Insertion
- Selection
- Merge
- Quick
- Bubble

## Runtime comparison  
| Algorithm  | Runtime | Maximum Runtime
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |  
|  Insertion |  O(n^2)  | O(n^2) | 
|  Selection |  O(n^2)  | O(n^2) | 
|  Merge |  O(nlogn)  | O(nlogn) | 
|  Quick |  O(nlogn)  | O(n^2) | 
|  Bubble |  O(n^2)  | O(n^2) |
